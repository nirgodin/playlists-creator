{
    "loudness": "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.",
    "danceability": "danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 100.0 is most danceable.",
    "energy": "energy is a measure from 0.0 to 100.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.",
    "speechiness": "speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 100.0 the attribute value. Values above 66.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 33.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.",
    "acousticness": "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 100.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 100.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.",
    "instrumentalness": "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. \"Ooh\" and \"aah\" sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly \"vocal\". The closer the instrumentalness value is to 100.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 50.0 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 100.0.",
    "liveness": "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 80.0 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.",
    "valence": "A measure from 0.0 to 100.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).",
    "language": "The language of the track's lyrics.",
    "key": "The key the track is in.",
    "main_genre": "The main genre of the track",
    "artist_gender": "The gender of the artist",
    "track_number": "The number of the track. If an album has several discs, the track number is the number on the specified disc.",
    "explicit": "Whether or not the track has explicit lyrics ( true = yes it does; false = no it does not OR unknown).",
    "album_tracks_number": "The number of tracks in the album.",
    "is_israeli": "A boolean value indicating whether the track is performed by an Israeli artist.",
    "mode": "mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.",
    "tempo": "The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.",
    "time_signature": "An estimated time signature. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure). The time signature ranges from 3 to 7 indicating time signatures of \"3/4\", to \"7/4\".",
    "popularity": "The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.\nGenerally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity.",
    "artist_followers": "The total number of artist followers.",
    "artist_popularity": "The popularity of the artist. The value will be between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The artist's popularity is calculated from the popularity of all the artist's tracks.",
    "israeli_radio_play_count": "The number of times the track was played in the Israeli radio during the past two years",
    "duration_minutes": "The duration of the track in minutes"
